# Life Expectancy Poster

This is an example of a poster I created as part of a project for a Data Analysis course in Spring 2023. The assignment asked us to answer an empirical question using appropriate data and statistical analysis, and to present this work in a poster. I decided to analyze what factors contribute to life expectancy. 

More specifically, my project looks at the relationship between life expectancy and education levels as well as if a country's development status affects average life expectancy. I found the analysis data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) where it had originally been pulled from the Global Health Observatory [data repository](https://www.who.int/data/gho) that is housed under the World Health Organization. This data set focuses on data from 193 countries during the time period 2000 - 2015.

Files for the project:
- 'Life Expectancy Data.csv' is the replication data
- 'Wallace Poster.Rmd' includes the code for creating the poster
- 'index.html' produces the output
